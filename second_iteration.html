        <div class="aboutme">I am a driven coder who has a keen eye for detail and I am excited to join and be part of the
        coding world. I have a natural curiosity in all things tech which is what attracted me to this line
        of work. My experience at Develop Me was extremely positive and I really enjoyed both the
        Front-end and Back-end parts of the course and in particular Laravel and React. I look
        forward to working with people who share my enthusiasm for coding. I am currently working
        for a company called moove.to based in Cardiff working remotely with Javascript, Laravel and
        PHP. We set up our website on an AWS EC2 instance and you can view what weâ€™ve done at
        https://staging.moove.to.</div>
